# Careers in Computer Science

# 1.1: Program Analyst Basics 


## What is a Program Analyst?
A Program Analyst's career is all about optimization. Program Analysts works on methods to improve computer processes, spanning from computer operating systems, programming algorithims, and analytical projects. The element of graphing is also important to an Analyst's job. Program Analysts look at trends, graphs, and procedures, and adapt computer systems to be effective for the oncoming patterns. A Program Analyst works in many fields, including finances, technology, and education. One of the best parts of a Program Analyst's job is that the use of programming languages is extremely common. The most commonly used languages for a Program Analyst are Python and SQL.
